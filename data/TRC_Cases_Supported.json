They were on their way back to Cradock. Two inquests were held in 1987 and 1993, respectively, but no one was ever prosecuted for the murders, despite the findings of the 1993 inquest. Prolonged delays led to most of the suspects passing away, and hopes for prosecution faded further when the last key suspect died in mid-2023. In early 2024, a third inquest was formally reopened. This inquest resumed in the Gqeberha High Court from 2 to 11 June 2025, focusing on testimony from the victims\u2019 families and their witnesses.

    "Case description ":"On October 22, 1986, Mxolisi Dicky Jacobs, a founder of the Upington Student Congress and UDF activist, was found dead, hanging in his cell at Upington Prison. He was arrested on June 12, 1986, by the Security Branch and held for 129 days, during which he was allegedly tortured. Fellow detainees found it unlikely he had committed suicide, as he was reportedly in good spirits prior to his death. The 1987 inquest was marred with inconsistencies. Although Dicky\u2019s case is still under investigation, with many records missing or destroyed, the family remains hopeful that they will one day find some measure of closure.",

    "Case description ":"Bathandwa Ndondo was an MK underground cadre and dedicated student activist from the University of Transkei. On 24 September 1985, Ndondo was abducted from his home in Cala by men in a minibus. He was seen trying to escape and shouting for help before being shot and killed in a neighbour\u2019s yard. The attack was carried out by Transkei Security Branch members and askaris from Vlakplaas. The trial into his death collapsed due to non-cooperation from the security forces. Six of Ndondo\u2019s associates and potential witnesses were banished to remote parts of Transkei following his killing. The Hawks are investigating the matter.",
