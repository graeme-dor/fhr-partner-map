The farmers received gardening tools, planting materials, educational materials and training workshops. These workshops equipped them with essential production skills, focusing on micro farm extension, permaculture principles, and soil fertility. This has resulted in the farmers having a flourishing micro farm that is enhancing food security and employment.
